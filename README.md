# 🌟 **GABY LANGIS' API Project**

Welcome to **My API Project**! This is a Node.js API that provides authentication and other functionalities. Below is a guide to get your environment up and running smoothly. 🚀✨

---
## 🛠️ **Prerequisites**

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- 🖥️ **Code Editor**: Visual Studio or Rider (for backend)  
- 🗂️ **Version Control**: Git  
- 🐳 **Containerization**: Docker  
- 📊 **Database Management**: pgAdmin4 or any preferred data grid tool  
- 🛠️ **Tools**: Git Bash

---
## 🖥️ **Client**

The client application that interfaces with this API can be found in the public repository:  
[**ClientAngular**](https://github.com/HelixQc/ClientAngular)  
Feel free to check it out for frontend integration!

## 🔑 **Postman Access**

You can interact with the API using **Postman**. To test the API, simply import the Postman collection provided or use the following base URL:

http://localhost:3000/api/Endpoint

> **Note:** Replace `<Endpoint>` with the appropriate method or endpoint you wish to call.



## 🌱 **Environment Variables**

To set up your environment, you will need to create an `.env` file in the root of your project. This file will contain configuration for sensitive variables like your database connection. 

Here's a sample format for the `.env` file: DATABASE_URL=YourConnectionString
> **Important:** Make sure to replace `YourConnectionString` with your actual database connection string. This is crucial for connecting the API to your database.

## 🛠️ **API Endpoints**

The API provides the following  endpoints:

## 🚀 **Getting Started**
### **Step 1: 🗂️ Create the Folder Structure**

1. 🏗️ Create a folder named `<Your folder name>`.    
2. 🔄 Clone the repository **REST_API_NodeJS** into the`<Your folder name>` folder using the command:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/HelixQc/REST_API_NodeJS.git
    ```


3. **Navigate to the project directory**:

    ```sh
    cd REST_API_NodeJS
    ```

4. **Install dependencies**:

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

5. **Create and configure the `.env` file** as explained in the previous section.

6. **Start the API**:

    ```sh
    npm start
    ```

   Your API should now be running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
